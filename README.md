I’m Kolade, a web-developer based in Nigeria. I love creating beautiful websites to provide intuitive and dynamic experience to users.

Since I learnt to code, I have always felt in love with the art of programming. The possibility of writing code from one tiny corner of the world to create applications which can be beneficial to people all around the world is an empowering experience.

Beside programming, I love travelling, spending time with my family, reading books and playing football.
